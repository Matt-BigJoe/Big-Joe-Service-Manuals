# Big Joe Forklifts â€“ Service Manuals (Online Repository)

This repository hosts public, link-only PDFs for Big Joe service manuals and a machine-readable `manifest.json` so assistants/GPTs can index and browse them easily.

## How this works
1. Upload your PDFs into the `manuals/` folder (web UI or git).
2. Keep the filenames as-is (they match the manifest).
3. Update the `manifest.json` `url` fields to point to your hosting (GitHub, GitHub Pages, or your domain).
4. Enable GitHub Pages (or any static hosting).

## Direct links
Once hosted, your PDFs will be available at:
```
https://<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io/bigjoe-service-manuals/manuals/<filename>.pdf
```
